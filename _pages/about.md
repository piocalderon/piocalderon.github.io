Hi, I'm **Pio**, a data scientist and a PhD student in the [Behavioral Data Science Lab](https://www.behavioral-ds.ml/) at the University of Technology Sydney. ✌️ 

Though I'm an applied mathematician by training, I'm mostly interested in working in areas that aren't conventionally *numerical* at first glance. I am fascinated by **Computational Social Science**, an area which tries to marry computational techniques and the study of human-related phenomena.

My first job was at university when I was still taking up my Masters in Applied Math. I worked as a research assistant in a study where we [modeled the response of the human body to exercise 🏃‍♂.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002555641630342X?via%3Dihub).

After graduating, I joined **Ayannah**, a local fintech 📈 startup. As their first data scientist hire, I acted as the de-facto [Head of Data Science](http://www.biznewsasia.com/ayannah-here-to-serve-you/) and had the job of setting the company's analytics direction. I conceptualized various projects with the end goal of understanding the existing customer base of the company.

Soon after I became interested in text analytics and decided to focus on that area. I joined **Neuro Flash**, a German neuromarketing-AI 🧠 startup, where we help brands optimize their marketing campaigns to be on-point and on-brand using an interesting mix of NLP, Image Analytics, and Machine Learning.

I work mostly in **Python** for full-stack data science: data wrangling, data viz, model building, and API development. Check out the [Data](https://piocalderon.github.io/data) and [Travel](https://piocalderon.github.io/travel/) tabs to see some cool viz!

Aside from data science, I love to **explore new places**, both real and virtual... but due to the coronavirus situation, recently more of the latter.

My last adventure was a two-month digital nomad trip through Chiang Mai, India and Bali during the first quarter of 2020. I'm on a mission to travel the 🌍. I'll write about my adventures when I have the time.
