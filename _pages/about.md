Hi, I'm **Pio**, a data scientist based in Manila. ✌️ 

My background is mostly in **applied mathematics** 🧮 and **computational modeling** 💻. Formally, I have a BSc in Physics and an MSc in Applied Math.

In general, I'm very interested in tackling problems from a computational and data-driven perspective, especially problems in areas that typically don't admit such approaches at first glance.

While doing my Masters in applied math, I worked as a research assistant for a study wherein we [modeled the response of the human body to exercise 🏃‍♂ using optimal control theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002555641630342X?via%3Dihub). Here I combined computational models and patient time series data in order to estimate patient body parameters.

After graduating, I joined a local fintech 📈 startup **Ayannah** as their first data scientist hire. There, I set up dashboards to track transactions and built models to estimate credit risk, profile customer behavior, and recommend products to customers. I also scraped the web for a lot of Filipino text data and built localized NLP models for various purposes.

Soon after I became very interested in text analytics and decided to focus on that area. I joined **Neuro Flash**, a German neuromarketing-AI 🧠 startup, where we help brands optimize their marketing campaigns to be on-point in terms of success and on-brand in terms of messaging.

I am interested in projects that involve **Text Analytics**, **Geospatial Analysis**, **Computational Social Science**, and **Data Visualization**. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills in these areas, and I suppose writing about these topics reinforces the learning process.

In terms of tools, I work mostly in **Python** for the full-stack data science process: data wrangling, data viz, model building, and API development. On the side, I'm also learning a bit of **JavaScript** and **D3.js** for interactive visualizations.

Aside from data science, I am also interested in **exploring new places**. My last adventure was a two-month digital nomad trip through Chiang Mai, India and Bali. I'm on a mission to travel the 🌍. I'll write about my adventures when I have the time.

This blog is best viewed on a PC because of D3!
