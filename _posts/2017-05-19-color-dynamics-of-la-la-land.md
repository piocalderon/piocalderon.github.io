La La Land is my favorite movie of 2017. Though it didn't win the top prize at the Oscars, it was certainly the most enjoyable cinematic experience for me. The visuals, the music, the acting: all 10s in my book. Watching the movie for the first time, what struck me the most was how vivid the colors on the screen were, and how different scenes in the movie were paired with distinct colors.

The movie was presented as a narrative of five chapters - Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter 5 years later. By using some basic video processing and unsupervised learning, we can decompose the movie into a flat range of colors, where dominant colors go from top to bottom and time runs from right to left. Apart from being really pretty, the resulting image could help us put a correspondence between colors and scenes (and correspondingly, emotions) in the movie.

## Winter
**Start**: Another Day of Sun.

**End**: Mia's audition. "*No, Jamal. You be trippin'.*"

Major events in winter are the opening number - Another Day of Sun - and Mia and Seb's second interaction, which happens after Seb gets fired from his piano gig. These two events are the most apparent in the color spectrum. Bright colors dominate the beginning of winter, particularly hues of blue. Midway, red takes some share of the spotlight, and then dark colors close it out.

## Spring
**Start**: The pool party where Seb is part of an 80s cover band.

**End**: Kiss at the Griffith Observatory.

Mia and Seb's relationship blossomed in spring. From initial annoyance to the first kiss at the observatory, spring goes through the motions of a love story's beginning. Notice how spring is dominated by the color purple, a personification of love, particularly during "A Lovely Night" and "Planetarium."

## Summer
**Start**: Mia starting to write her one-woman show.

**End**: Seb's concert.

Summer is the shortest season in the movie. It starts out with red, turns to green, then closes out with a fight between red and blue during "Start a Fire." According to [Film School Rejects](https://filmschoolrejects.com/color-in-la-la-land-26939a11accd/), red, blue and green are said to represent reality, control and a change, respectively. The green during summer corresponds to "City of Stars," which precludes the eventual fall-out of Mia and Seb.

## Fall
**Start**: Mia sending invites to her one-woman show.

**End**: Mia and Seb breaking up (but still loving each other).

Fall continues the green from summer, which corresponds to Mia and Seb's fight. After green fades, we see that the bright colors of the movie also die out, leaving only black and white ("Audition").

## Winter (5 years later)
**Start**: Mia walking to coffee shop.

**End**: Mia and Seb's final smile.

Winter 5 years later is almost devoid of bright colors. The only tinge of brightness we see is "Epilogue," a fantasy of the what-ifs in the story of Mia and Seb. Notice also the blue tinges spread throughout winter. As mentioned earlier, blue represents control. At this point, Mia and Seb were finally able to achieve what they want in their respective careers, at the expense of each other.
